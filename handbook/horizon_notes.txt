Issues with the factory horizon screen:
* ground color too dark
* ticks on the edge not helpful and take up space
* no "airplane icon" - harder to perceive pitch and bank
* no adjustment for "pitch zero"
* pitch depiction may not be sensitive enough
* computationally inefficient: redraws too often and uses a lot of trig

The alternative horizon display in the MBdev branch:
* offers several schemes for colors and lines
* is uncluttered, some elements are optional
* easy to see 30, 45 and 60 degree bank angles
* offers 2 sizes for an "airplane icon"
* adjust pitch via the rotary knob
* is highly optimized for computational efficiency, and thus
* updates rapidly and without flickering
