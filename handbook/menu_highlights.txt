Highlights of the menus:

Top menu:  similar to the old menus, a little shorter:

MC or volume
QNH
airfield elevation
bugs
ballast
crew weight
  - student mode here has only a partial audio menu & the entry for exiting student mode
glider details
audio
options
system

Audio menu:

volume
mute
cruise audio
tone styles
range
exponent

FLARM (alarm options)
G-load display (submenu with thresholds, limits, etc)
Horizon display (submenu with style options)
advanced options

advanced options menu:

    - includes circling wind  (straight wind is under compass)
altimeter, airspeed
display setup
rotary setup (does not include choice of screens, they are within the two below)
enter student mode

System menu:

communications
hardware
software version & update
factory reset

Communications menu:

master_mode (ideally sets mode, for now just reports mode)
NMEA protocol
wireless
wired
data routing

For example the S1 submenu under "wired" includes:
baud rate
loops
TX inversion
RX inversion
twist
TX enable
(but not routing!)

data routing menu:

wireless<>XCV routing enable/disable
S1 routing
S2 routing
CAN routing
Port 2000 routing
data monitor (this is not just wireless)

Each data route appears in only one place, for example the S1 routes are:
    xcv
    s2
    wifi port 8881
therefore the S2 routes do not list S1 again, they are:
    xcv
    wifi port 8882
which leaves plenty of room for expansion.  For example:
I intend to eventually add 8880 to S1 and 8880 and 8881 to S2

Hardware menu:

AS sensor
flaps (submenu) (moved from main "options")
gear warning
compass (submenu) (moved from main "options")
